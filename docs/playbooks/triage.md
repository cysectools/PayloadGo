# Security Finding Triage Playbook

This playbook provides standardized procedures for triaging security findings discovered by PayloadGo Enterprise.

## Overview

The triage process ensures that security findings are properly categorized, prioritized, and routed to the appropriate teams for remediation. This playbook covers the complete lifecycle from discovery to resolution.

## Triage Workflow

### 1. Initial Assessment

**Immediate Actions (0-2 hours)**
- [ ] Verify finding authenticity
- [ ] Assess potential impact
- [ ] Determine if finding is exploitable
- [ ] Check for false positives
- [ ] Assign initial severity

**Critical Findings (Immediate Response)**
- [ ] Notify security team immediately
- [ ] Escalate to management if needed
- [ ] Implement temporary mitigations
- [ ] Document all actions taken

### 2. Severity Classification

#### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- **Definition**: Immediate threat to system security
- **Examples**: Remote code execution, SQL injection with data access
- **Response Time**: 2 hours
- **Actions**:
  - [ ] Immediate notification to security team
  - [ ] Escalate to CISO/management
  - [ ] Implement emergency controls
  - [ ] Begin incident response if exploited

#### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
- **Definition**: Significant security risk
- **Examples**: Privilege escalation, sensitive data exposure
- **Response Time**: 24 hours
- **Actions**:
  - [ ] Notify security team
  - [ ] Assign to development team
  - [ ] Plan remediation timeline
  - [ ] Monitor for exploitation

#### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- **Definition**: Moderate security risk
- **Examples**: Information disclosure, limited privilege escalation
- **Response Time**: 7 days
- **Actions**:
  - [ ] Assign to development team
  - [ ] Include in next sprint planning
  - [ ] Document remediation approach

#### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- **Definition**: Minor security risk
- **Examples**: Information leakage, minor configuration issues
- **Response Time**: 30 days
- **Actions**:
  - [ ] Add to backlog
  - [ ] Plan for future release
  - [ ] Document in security register

### 3. False Positive Analysis

**Common False Positive Indicators**
- [ ] Payload reflected but properly encoded
- [ ] Error messages that don't reveal sensitive information
- [ ] Expected behavior in test environments
- [ ] WAF/security tool interference

**False Positive Verification Process**
1. [ ] Review raw request/response data
2. [ ] Test payload in controlled environment
3. [ ] Verify with security team
4. [ ] Document reasoning
5. [ ] Mark as false positive with explanation

### 4. Finding Assignment

**Assignment Matrix**

| Finding Type | Primary Owner | Secondary Owner | SLA |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|-----|
| Web Application | Development Team | Security Team | 7 days |
| Infrastructure | DevOps Team | Security Team | 5 days |
| API Security | API Team | Security Team | 3 days |
| Database | DBA Team | Security Team | 5 days |

**Assignment Process**
1. [ ] Identify appropriate team based on finding type
2. [ ] Assign primary and secondary owners
3. [ ] Set SLA based on severity
4. [ ] Notify assigned teams
5. [ ] Schedule follow-up meetings

### 5. Remediation Planning

**Remediation Steps**
1. [ ] **Analysis**: Understand root cause
2. [ ] **Design**: Plan secure solution
3. [ ] **Implementation**: Code and deploy fix
4. [ ] **Testing**: Verify fix effectiveness
5. [ ] **Validation**: Re-scan to confirm resolution

**Remediation Templates**

#### SQL Injection
```sql
-- Before (Vulnerable)
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $user_id;

-- After (Secure)
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?;
-- Use parameterized queries
```

#### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
```html
<!-- Before (Vulnerable) -->
<div>{{user_input}}</div>

<!-- After (Secure) -->
<div>{{user_input|escape}}</div>
<!-- Use proper output encoding -->
```

#### Authentication Bypass
```python
# Before (Vulnerable)
if user_id == request.user_id:
    return True

# After (Secure)
if authenticate_user(request.user_id, request.token):
    return True
# Implement proper authentication checks
```

### 6. Verification and Closure

**Verification Checklist**
- [ ] Fix has been implemented
- [ ] Security testing confirms resolution
- [ ] No regression issues introduced
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Stakeholders notified

**Closure Process**
1. [ ] Verify fix effectiveness
2. [ ] Update finding status to "Resolved"
3. [ ] Document remediation steps
4. [ ] Archive finding with resolution notes
5. [ ] Update security metrics

## Finding Types and Remediation

### Web Application Vulnerabilities

#### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact**: Session hijacking, credential theft
- **Remediation**: Output encoding, Content Security Policy
- **Testing**: Verify encoding, test with various payloads

#### SQL Injection
- **Impact**: Database compromise, data theft
- **Remediation**: Parameterized queries, input validation
- **Testing**: SQL injection testing, database monitoring

#### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact**: Unauthorized actions on behalf of users
- **Remediation**: CSRF tokens, SameSite cookies
- **Testing**: CSRF token validation, request origin checking

### API Security Issues

#### Authentication Bypass
- **Impact**: Unauthorized access to APIs
- **Remediation**: Proper authentication, token validation
- **Testing**: Authentication flow testing, token validation

#### Authorization Flaws
- **Impact**: Privilege escalation, data access
- **Remediation**: Role-based access control, permission checks
- **Testing**: Authorization testing, privilege escalation

### Infrastructure Vulnerabilities

#### Server Misconfiguration
- **Impact**: Information disclosure, service compromise
- **Remediation**: Secure configuration, regular updates
- **Testing**: Configuration scanning, security hardening

#### Network Security Issues
- **Impact**: Network compromise, data interception
